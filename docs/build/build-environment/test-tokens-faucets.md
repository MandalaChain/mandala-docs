# Test Tokens (Faucets)

A faucet is the site/place where you can get testnet tokens. Faucets are available for the Niskala testnet accounts in the form of KPGT. Use them to make sure your wallet has enough assets to cover the cost of deployment and pay transaction gas.

## What is the KPGT faucet for?

Tokens on Mandala Chain Testnets like Niskala do not have any real-world value besides **experimenting** with the features on the network.

## How to get KPGT faucet?

To receive testnet tokens, please follow these steps:

1. Join our Discord server: https://discord.com/invite/MwUQgQZgxm
2. Navigate to the dedicated faucet channel
3. Use the command `/drip <your_public_key>` in the chat

Please remember that our team will **NEVER DM** you first, and we **NEVER ASK** for your _**money**_ in exchange for the faucets!

If you get approached by someone _pretending_ to be part of the team, do NOT engage with them. Instead, please use the official Discord faucet channel mentioned above.
