# Test Tokens (Faucets)

A faucet is a dedicated platform where users can obtain test tokens to facilitate development and testing on the Niskala network. In this documentation, we will explore effective methods to acquire KPGT tokens.

## How to get KPGT faucet?

To receive testnet tokens, please follow these steps:

1. Join our Discord server: https://discord.com/invite/MwUQgQZgxm
2. Navigate to the dedicated faucet channel
3. Use the command `/drip <your_public_key>` in the chat

Please remember that our team will **NEVER DM** you first, and we **NEVER ASK** for your _**money**_ in exchange for the faucets!

If you get approached by someone _pretending_ to be part of the team, do NOT engage with them. Instead, please use the official Discord faucet channel mentioned above.
